# test-v1

## Chnages:

1. Created better category per job tags
2. Added perecentage calculations in reco jobs depending on weight results
3. Add stricter restrictions on jobs thats not related to any categories to avoid unraleted recos

## Observation
Right now it become more strict in recommending personally i think much more accurate how ever not every time 5 jobs will be reccomended due to i think low numbers of sample_jobs
